## Overview

My first challenge for the front end mentor website input and guidance on what I can do better would be apreciated.


### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

How to use border-radius and how to link fonts to use in a website.


### Continued development

I would like to make more use of relative values instead of using px values so much.
